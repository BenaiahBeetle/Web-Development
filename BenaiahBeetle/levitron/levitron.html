          <h3>Superconductors</h3>
          <p>Explore studies on high-temperature superconductors and materials suitable for Levitron.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Explanation of the Messiner Effect and Quantam Locking</p>
        
        <!-- Quantum Locking Subsection -->
        <h4>Quantum Locking</h4>
        <p>
            Quantum locking occurs because of a phenomenon called <strong>flux pinning</strong>. Imagine a superconductor placed above a magnetic field. Normally, magnetic field lines would pass straight through most materials, but in a superconductor, these lines can’t move freely due to the <em>Meissner effect</em> (explained next).
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, magnetic field lines become trapped in tiny defects within the superconducting material, which "locks" the superconductor in place above the magnet. Even if you try to move the superconductor, the trapped magnetic field lines act like invisible tethers, preventing free movement. This "locking" effect enables the superconductor to hover over the magnet and maintain a fixed position, even when flipped or rotated. It appears as though the superconductor is "locked" in space above the magnet.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Meissner Effect Subsection -->
        <h4>The Meissner Effect</h4>
        <p>
            The Meissner effect is a property of superconductors that allows them to repel magnetic fields. When a material becomes superconducting, typically at very low temperatures (often achieved using liquid nitrogen), it actively pushes out any magnetic fields within itself. This behavior differentiates superconductors from regular magnets, which generally align with external magnetic fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple terms, a superconductor generates an opposing magnetic field that repels outside magnetic fields. This is why it can "levitate" above a magnet—the superconductor's opposing field pushes against the magnet's field, keeping it suspended in place. This effect resembles the repulsion between like poles of two magnets.

          <h3>Braking System</h3>
          <p>Implementation of Eddy currents for smooth deceleration, comparing other braking technologies like regenerative braking.</p>
            <h3><strong>Current Braking with Electromagnets</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Implementing an eddy current braking system using electromagnets involves setting up electromagnets on the underside of the vehicle to interact with a conductive track or metal grid beneath it. This innovative approach leverages magnetic principles to achieve controlled, frictionless braking.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Principle of Eddy Currents</h4>
            <p>
                Eddy currents are loops of electrical current generated within a conductor exposed to a changing magnetic field. As the Levitron moves over the conductive track, the electromagnets induce eddy currents in the metal beneath. These eddy currents create an opposing magnetic field that resists the vehicle’s motion, slowing it down.
            </p>

            <a href="https://thrillsyndicate.com/the-science-of-eddy-current-magnetic-braking/">The Science of eddy currents and magnetic braking</a>
    
            <h4>Electromagnets for Controlled Braking</h4>
            <p>
                By using programmable electromagnets rather than permanent magnets, the braking force becomes adjustable. Adjusting the current to the electromagnets allows for fine-tuning the braking force based on the vehicle's speed, which is essential for various driving conditions and for achieving smooth stops.
            </p>
    
            <h4>How It Works in Motion</h4>
            <p>
                As the Levitron glides over the conductive grid, activating the electromagnets below, it induces eddy currents in the metal track. These eddy currents create a magnetic field opposing the Levitron’s magnetic field, generating a resistive force. By increasing the current to the electromagnets, the strength of the magnetic field—and thus the braking force—can be adjusted as needed.
            </p>

            <h4>Advantages and Energy Recovery Potential</h4>
            <p>
                One significant advantage of eddy current braking is that it’s frictionless, eliminating wear and tear on components. Additionally, some designs allow for capturing part of the braking energy, which could be stored for reuse, enhancing energy efficiency.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Setup Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooling and Power Management:</strong> Electromagnets may generate heat, so a cooling system is essential to prevent overheating.</li>
                <li><strong>System Control:</strong> A control system manages braking force based on the vehicle’s speed and required deceleration, ensuring smooth and controlled stops.</li>

          <h3>Ionic Thruster system</h3>
          <h4>Thruster Positioning</h4>
          <p>
              The Levitron’s thrusters are positioned in a rear configuration for primary forward thrust, while smaller thrusters are placed on each side or corner of the vehicle. This arrangement allows for precise control, enabling not only forward motion but also stabilization and slight directional adjustments. Such control is especially important given the Levitron's levitating design, which requires fine-tuned stability.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Diagram showing the thruster design for Levitron</figcaption>
        </figure>
          
          <h4>Ion Acceleration Process</h4>
          <p>
              Each thruster utilizes electrodes that apply high voltage to create an electric field. This field accelerates ions (often sourced from a fuel like xenon or argon) out of the thruster. As the positively charged ions are expelled at high velocity, they propel the vehicle forward through momentum, creating a smooth and controlled thrust suitable for the Levitron’s propulsion system.
          </p>

        </div>        
  
          <h4>Power Source and Management</h4>
          <p>
              Powering the ionic thrusters requires a substantial and consistent electrical supply. The Levitron’s superconducting system could channel power to these thrusters from a central power source, capable of generating the necessary high voltage. This approach ensures consistent acceleration without impacting the vehicle’s levitation, maintaining stability while providing thrust.
          </p>
  
          <h4>Advantages and Considerations</h4>
          <p>
              Ionic thrusters are known for being energy-efficient, requiring minimal fuel and generating very little heat or noise. However, they produce low thrust, which should make them useless. Except this low thrust is perfect for Levitron's design because it is frictionless travel. So, even with low thrust we can gain normal car speeds of today. Our only enemy is air resistance/drag which can be overcome by an aerodynamic design.
